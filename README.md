# Euphoria - Shop for a used underwear fetishists ðŸ’‹

https://euphorianoszonabielizna.pl/

<br />

### About Project

The project is basically my wife's website, for a while she was only using Allegro for selling worn underwear until I've started learning programming. There are couple reasons why I've made this
project but most important ones are: no commission on the sale and she doesnt care about their really stupid terms of use, by that I mean (all images on rgba(255,255,255) background) wich doesnt encourages clients at all.
Also creating fully working shop with couple of nice features was pretty challenging and most important, FUN!.
